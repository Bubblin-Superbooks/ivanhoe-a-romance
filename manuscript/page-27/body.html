   And flesh-meat I eat never,
   But milk of the kye;
   Warm thee well, and go to sleep,
   And I will lap thee with my cope,
   Softly to lye.”</p></blockquote><p>It would seem that the manuscript is here imperfect, for we do not find the reasons which finally induce the curtal Friar to amend the King's cheer.

Two candles are placed on a table, white bread and baked pasties are displayed by the light, besides choice of venison, both salt and fresh, from which they select collops. “I might have eaten my bread dry,” said the King, “had I not pressed thee on the score of archery, but now have I dined like a prince—if we had but drink enow.”</p></div> </div>
