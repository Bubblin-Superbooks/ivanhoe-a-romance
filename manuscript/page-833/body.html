   Dark sits the evening upon the thanes castle,
   The black clouds gather round;
   Soon shall they be red as the blood of the valiant!
   The destroyer of forests shall shake his red crest against
   them.
   He, the bright consumer of palaces,
   Broad waves he his blazing banner,
   Red, wide and dusky,
   Over the strife of the valiant:
   His joy is in the clashing swords and broken bucklers;
   He loves to lick the hissing blood as it bursts warm from the
   wound!</p></blockquote><blockquote class="  "><p>   4.
   All must perish!
   The sword cleaveth the helmet;
