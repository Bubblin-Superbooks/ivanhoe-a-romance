   I ope my brass-embossed book,
   Portray'd with many a holy deed
   Of martyrs crown'd with heavenly meed;
   Then, as my taper waxes dim,
   Chant, ere I sleep, my measured hymn.</p></blockquote><p>Who but would cast his pomp away,</p><blockquote><p>   To take my staff and amice grey,
   And to the world's tumultuous stage,
   Prefer the peaceful Hermitage?
   â€”Warton</p></blockquote><p>Notwithstanding the prescription of the genial hermit, with which his guest willingly complied, he found it no easy matter to bring the harp to harmony.</p></div> </div>
