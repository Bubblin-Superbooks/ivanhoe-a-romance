   No comfort on earth save the Barefooted Friar's.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   3.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Your monarch?—Pshaw! many a prince has been known
   To barter his robes for our cowl and our gown,
   But which of us e'er felt the idle desire
   To exchange for a crown the grey hood of a Friar!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   4.</p></blockquote></div> </div>
