   Return'd from yonder land of gold;
   No wealth he brings, nor wealth can need,
   Save his good arms and battle-steed
   His spurs, to dash against a foe,
   His lance and sword to lay him low;
   Such all the trophies of his toil,
   Such—and the hope of Tekla's smile!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   3.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   “Joy to the fair! whose constant knight
   Her favour fired to feats of might;
   Unnoted shall she not remain,
   Where meet the bright and noble train;
   Minstrel shall sing and herald tell—
   'Mark yonder maid of beauty well,
   'Tis she for whose bright eyes were won
   The listed field at Askalon!</p></blockquote></div> </div>
