<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote class="no-indent  ">THOU, long-suffering, slow to wrath,
   A burning, and a shining light!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>   Our harps we left by Babel's streams,
   The tyrant's jest, the Gentile's scorn;
   No censer round our altar beams,
   And mute our timbrel, trump, and horn.
   But THOU hast said, the blood of goat,
   The flesh of rams, I will not prize;
   A contrite heart, and humble thought,
   Are mine accepted sacrifice.</p></blockquote><p>When the sounds of Rebecca's devotional hymn had died away in silence, the low knock at the door was again renewed. “Enter,” she said, “if thou art a friend; and if a foe, I have not the means of refusing thy entrance.”</p></div> </div>
